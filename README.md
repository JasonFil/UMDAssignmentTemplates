# README

This repo provides a _LaTeX_ template for formatting CS UMD assignments. As with most Computer Science departments worldwide, we have opted to take advantage of the platform [`Gradescope`](https://www.gradescope.com/) for grading of our assignments. This template provides _LaTeX_ commands for formatting one's assignment in a Gradescope-friendly manner, taking advantage of *AI-assisted submission clustering* wherever possible. The template can be used for *both* homework assignment *and* exam formatting.

## CONTENTS

`template/`: A directory of all macros split across files. Examples:

- `template/mymath.tex` contains many macros useful for courses such as *CMSC250, Discrete Mathematics*. Those macros help with the formatting of quantifiers, negations, as well as the size of symbols and formatting of formulae.

- `template/code.tex` contains a specific configuration of the package [`lstlistings`](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Source_Code_Listings), which is a great package for formatting source code in _LaTeX_. Useful  in coding-heavy courses such as *CMSC420, Data Structures*.

`examples`: a set of example assignments produced by this template. Free for experimentation!

`README.md`: The current **Markdown**-formatted text file.

`LICENSE`: Copy of the license for this repository.

`.gitignore`: Git ignore file.
