\problem{Git basics}{22}

To pull the starter code for our projects, you will need to familiarize yourselves with the VCS \textbf{Git}, since the entire skeleton code will be hosted on a \href{https://github.com/JasonFil/CMSC420-Fall2018}{GitHub repository} that we maintain for you. To answer this problem effectively, you will need to study up on Git. Please navigate to the page named ``More Resources" on our \href{https://myelms.umd.edu/courses/1246980}{ELMS website} if you would like a starting point. Of course, Google is always your friend.

While a large subset of Git's functionality can be implemented using \href{https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux}{various graphical tools}, there is {\bf no substitute} for the modularity, ease and cross-platform compatibility of using simple command line instructions from the shell. In this class, you will need to familiarize yourselves with a {\bf very basic} subset of available Git commands.

For every one of the following tasks, write the {\bf full} command that would be necessary to type on a command line in order for you to achieve the relevant task. Your answer should include: 
	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{.5em}
		\item The system program {\tt git}.
		\item The command to be passed to the program {\tt git} (e.g. {\tt add}, {\tt checkout}, {\tt push}, etc).
		\item Any flags to be passed to the command, e.g {\tt -b}, {\tt --cached}, {\tt -u}.
		\item Arguments that the command itself may need (e.g branch names, file paths, names of remotes, entire quoted strings, etc).
	\end{itemize}
	
You are {\bf quite encouraged} to try the commands out in your console before writing your responses below. In fact, the first four commands are a fine example of how you could start implementing your first project! We will provide you with the answer to the first question to help start you off. Note that this command does not have any \textbf{flags}, but it does, of course, have a URL argument.

\problem{Sparse Matrix Representations}{20} 

Whether stored in column or row - major order, two-dimensional matrices can be a big bottleneck in terms of memory if they are \textbf{sparse}, that is, they have lots of {\tt null} cells. For example, the matrix shown in Table \ref{tbl:sparseMat} is quite sparse; only about $14\%$ of it is occupied!

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
	\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c c c c c} 
		\  & \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} & \textbf{6} & \textbf{7} \\ \hline 
		\textbf{\Xt} & \textbf{11} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt \\
		\textbf{1} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & $\mathbf{3}$ & \Xt & \Xt \\
		\textbf{2} & \Xt & \textbf{-3} & \textbf{4} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt \\
		\textbf{3} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt \\	
		\textbf{4} & \Xt & \Xt & \textbf{11} & \textbf{6} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & $\mathbf{e^2}$ \\
		\textbf{5} & \textbf{-1} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt \\
		\textbf{6} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & $\mathbf{\sqrt{3}}$ & \Xt \\
		\textbf{7} & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt & \Xt \\	
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{A sparse matrix.  \Xt = \texttt{null} for brevity.}
	\label{tbl:sparseMat}
\end{table}

Programming languages such as {\tt MATLAB} offer built-in functionality (methods or operators included in the ``standard library" of the language) to {\em sparsify} a matrix. Sparsifying a matrix consists of transforming it into a l\textbf{inked list} which contains information {\em only for those cells of the matrix that have been filled in}. Every node of this list contains the $(i, j)$ coordinates of the relevant cell, as well as the data originally held in the cell. 

To answer some of the following questions, you will have to review {\bf asymptotic notation}. We have a resource page on ELMS (with CMSC250 slides linked) where you can review ``big-Oh" (\bigoh{$\cdot$}), ``big-Theta" (\bigtheta{$\cdot$}) and ``big-Omega" (\bigomega{$\cdot$}). 

For example, if you believe that a certain operation has time complexity {\em at most proportional to} $M$ (e.g, $2M, 2.5M, 4M - 7$), you should answer with \bigoh{$M$}. If instead you believe that it has time complexity at most proportional to the \textbf{square} of $M$ multipled by $N$ (e.g, $10 M ^2N + 2N$), you should answer with \bigoh{$M^2 N$}. If you believe that the operation runs in time {\bf exactly} proportional to $M^2 \cdot N$, you should answer with \bigtheta{$M^2 \cdot N$}.

\problem{Memory representations of graphs}{20} 

Observe the graph of figure \ref{fig:graph}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{A conceptual image of a graph. Nodes are enumerated from  $0$ (zero) \\ for consistency with later drawings.}
	\label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}

There are two common ways in which graphs, directed or undirected, are represented in computer memory: the {\bf adjacency matrix} (Table \ref{tbl:adjMat}) and the \textbf{adjacency list} (Figure \ref{fig:adjList}).  

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
		\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.5}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
			&   \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} \\ \hline
		\textbf{0} & 0  & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0  & 0 \\ \hline
		\textbf{1} & 5  & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
		\textbf{2} & 1  & 6 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
		\textbf{3} & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 0 \\ \hline
		\textbf{4} & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
		\textbf{5} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
	\end{tabular} 
	\caption{The {\bf adjacency matrix} representation of the graph of Figure \ref{fig:graph}.}
	\label{tbl:adjMat}
\end{table}

Let $V$ be the number of {\bf nodes} (or vertices) in a given graph $G$ and $E$ be the number of its \textbf{edges}. The adjacency matrix is a $V \times V$ matrix $M$ where: 

$$M(i, j) = \begin{cases} w, & \textit{where } w > 0 \textit{ is the weight of the edge } i \rightarrow j \\ 0,  & \textit{if there is no edge } i \rightarrow j \end{cases}$$

In \textbf{unweighted} graphs, $w = 1$ for all edges. 

{\bf Undirected} graphs, on the other hand, have the interesting property that their adjacency matrix is   {\bf symmetric}: 

$$(\forall i , j \in \{ 1, 2, \dots , V \})[M(i, j ) = M(j, i)]$$. 

The {\bf adjacency list} representation of this graph is a single-dimensional array $A$ of length $V$, defined as follows:

$$A(i) = \{ v,\ \textit{if vertex } v \textit{ is connected to vertex  } i \textit{ in } G \}$$

\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=.8]{img/adjList}
	\caption{The {\bf adjacency list} representation of the graph of Figure \ref{fig:graph}. Every node \\ in the list contains a tuple (\textbf{target\_node\_id, weight}).}
	\label{fig:adjList}
\end{figure}

So $A(i)$ points to the \textbf{set} of all vertices $v$ on which $i$ is incident. These sets are typically organized as \textbf{linked lists}, as implied by Figure \ref{fig:adjList}. These lists do \textbf{not have to be sorted in any way}. For this question, we will assume that:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The heads of the sets are contained in a classic, one-dimensional contiguous storage array ({\bf not} a ``dynamic" array like Java's {\tt ArrayList} and C++'s {\tt Vector}). So the entire adjacency list representation will consist of an \textbf{array of lists} (see Figure \ref{fig:adjList}).
		\item The lists themselves are organized as {\bf classic, bare-bones linked lists}. This means that we will {\bf not} endow these lists with a pointer to their last element, and we will also {\bf not} have a link pointing to the previous node from every node (i.e the linked lists are {\bf not} doubly-connected) (see Figure \ref{fig:adjList}).
	\end{itemize} 
	
Furthermore, we add a little twist to these representations, based on information from problem 4. We will consider a {\bf sparse adjacency matrix} representation of this graph (linked list of only non-{\tt null} elements). Figure \ref{fig:sparseAdjMat} shows how the graph of Figure \ref{fig:graph} is represented in such a format.

\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=.8]{img/sparseAdjMat}
		\caption{The {\bf sparse adjacency matrix} representation of the graph of Figure 
		\ref{fig:graph}. The matrix has been scanned in row-major order (but does it really matter which order we use?)}
	\label{fig:sparseAdjMat}
\end{figure}

 Your task is to fill-in Table \ref{tbl:complexities} using appropriate complexity notation, coupled with the parameters $V$ and $E$. For example, if you believe that a certain operation will take time \textit{proportional} to the {\bf cube} of the number of nodes $V$, you should answer with \bigoh{$V^3$}. Or, if you believe that the operation will take time proportional to the product of vertices multiplied by the logarithm base 2 of the number of edges $E$, you should answer \bigoh{$V \cdot \log_2E$}. Finally, also consider the fact that $0 \leq E \leq V^2$, since the ``worst case" for the number of edges in a graph is $V^2$, for a $V$-clique.

% STUDENT: You have to place your answer in between the appropriate ampersands ('&') below.
% For example, if you want to fill-in the top-leftmost cell, you would need to write down your answer % in between the 1st and 2nd ampersand of the first line of the table.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{2.0}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{4.5cm}|c|c|c|} \hline
